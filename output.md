## II. Company Overview and History

### Founding and Early Years (1994-2000)

Cognizant Technology Solutions traces its origins to Chennai, India, where it was established on January 26, 1994, as Dun & Bradstreet Satyam Software (DBSS). This entity was a 76:24 joint venture between Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) and Satyam Computers, with Kumar Mahadeva and Srini Raju as its founding CEOs and MDs. Initially, DBSS functioned as an in-house technology unit for Dun & Bradstreet, concentrating on implementing extensive IT projects for D&B's various businesses. It began with a modest team of 50 employees.

In 1996, a pivotal moment occurred as the company broadened its scope to seek clients beyond Dun & Bradstreet. The same year, Dun & Bradstreet spun off several subsidiaries, including DBSS, to form a new entity named Cognizant Corporation, also headquartered in Chennai. Just three months later, in 1997, DBSS rebranded itself as Cognizant Technology Solutions, a name chosen to reflect its commitment to being knowledgeable and informed about client needs and emerging technologies.

In 1998, Cognizant Corporation underwent further restructuring, splitting into IMS Health and Nielsen Media Research. Following this, Cognizant Technology Solutions became a public subsidiary of IMS Health. In June 1998, IMS Health partially spun off Cognizant Technology Solutions through an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ exchange, raising approximately $34 million. During this nascent period, Cognizant primarily focused on Y2K-related services and the maintenance of existing software applications.

### Growth and Expansion (2000-2010)

Following the dot-com bust and the successful navigation of the Y2K transition, Cognizant strategically pivoted to offer a wider array of IT services and consulting. This period saw the rapid expansion of its service portfolio to include application development, complex systems integration, and business process outsourcing (BPO). A key component of its strategy involved combining lower-cost offshore development centers, predominantly in India, with client-facing teams in the United States and Europe. Lakshmi Narayanan succeeded Kumar Mahadeva as CEO, further guiding the company's growth.

The mid-2000s marked another significant development with the establishment of a dedicated management consulting practice, Cognizant Consulting. Unlike traditional standalone consulting firms, Cognizant integrated its consultants across industry-focused vertical units (e.g., financial services, healthcare) and horizontal practice areas (e.g., analytics, mobile, testing). This embedded approach ensured seamless collaboration between consulting and technical teams, providing strategic advice and digital transformation roadmaps tightly integrated with the broader service delivery. Cognizant became one of the industry's largest recruiters of MBAs, underscoring its commitment to combining business advisory talent with technology projects.

### Strategic Milestones (2011-Present)

The 2010s ushered in a period of substantial scaling and strategic acquisitions for Cognizant. In 2007, Francisco D'Souza took over as CEO, under whose leadership the company experienced significant growth, with revenue escalating from $1.4 billion in 2007 to over $16 billion by 2019. Cognizant achieved Fortune 500 status in 2011, solidifying its position as a major U.S. corporation by revenue. It was also added to the NASDAQ-100 Index in 2004 and the S&P 500 Index in 2006.

A landmark acquisition occurred in September 2014 when Cognizant acquired TriZetto Corp, a prominent healthcare IT services provider, for approximately $2.7 billion. This acquisition significantly expanded Cognizant's capabilities in the lucrative healthcare sector, becoming its largest acquisition to date.

In 2019, Brian Humphries succeeded Francisco D'Souza as CEO, focusing the company's efforts on digital transformation services and cloud migration to address evolving market demands. Subsequently, in January 2023, Ravi Kumar S was appointed CEO, replacing Brian Humphries, with a strategic emphasis on accelerating growth and expanding digital services, particularly in AI. Under his leadership, Cognizant continues to strategically invest in digital capabilities, including AI, data analytics, and cloud services, while pursuing targeted acquisitions to enhance its offerings and global presence. A notable recent acquisition is Belcan in June 2024.

### Global Presence and Workforce

Cognizant maintains a robust global footprint, serving clients worldwide. While headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey, U.S., a significant portion of its operations and workforce are based in India.

Other major centers in India include Bangalore, Bhubaneswar, Coimbatore, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Kochi, Kolkata, Mangalore, Mumbai, Noida, and Pune.

Cognizant is deeply committed to corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices, integrating them into its business strategy and operations. The company's efforts are guided by its purpose to "engineer modern businesses to improve everyday life".

### ESG Framework and Reporting

Cognizant has a proven track record of proactively addressing stakeholder demands for ESG data disclosure.
*   **Comprehensive Reporting:** Since 2020, Cognizant has published ESG reports that align with leading global frameworks and recommendations, including the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The company also discloses to CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) and has signed on to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs).
*   **Internal Governance:** Oversight of sustainability initiatives, policies, and disclosures is managed by the Chief Corporate Affairs Officer (CCAO) and Chief Environment Officer (CENVO), with periodic reviews and input from the CEO, senior leaders, and relevant Board committees. This robust governance structure ensures accountability and integrates ESG considerations into strategic decision-making.
*   **Automated Reporting:** Cognizant has implemented an automated ESG reporting process using platforms like Workiva to streamline data collection and ensure transparent, accurate, and auditable non-financial disclosures, eliminating reliance on disparate data sources and manual compilation.

### Environmental Sustainability

Cognizant's environmental strategy focuses on mitigating its ecological footprint and addressing climate-related risks and opportunities:
*   **Net Zero Emissions Commitment:** Cognizant is committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040, aiming for a 90% reduction in total emissions compared to its 2019 baseline by that year. An interim target is a 50% reduction in total emissions by 2030.

*   **Sustainability Solutions for Clients:** Cognizant also leverages its expertise to help clients reduce their own emissions through lower-carbon technology and enhanced skilling, emphasizing that truly sustainable business involves looking beyond one's own footprint. An example is IRENO, an AI and ML-backed smart optimizer that helps utilities harness clean energy for a sustainable future, predicting and prescribing analytics in real-time to reduce costs, improve visibility, and ensure regulatory compliance.

### Social Impact Programs

Cognizant's social impact initiatives are channeled through various programs aimed at uplifting individuals and communities:

The Synapse initiative, aimed at skilling one million individuals by 2026, is a critical part of this effort, providing cutting-edge technology skills for the digital age.
*   **Volunteerism and Philanthropic Grants:** Since 2020 alone, over 31,000 associates have volunteered more than 221,000 hours, contributing to a cumulative 3.4 million volunteer hours since Outreach's inception. Cognizant makes philanthropic grants and engages in mentoring and education partnerships in focus markets like the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Germany, aiming to unlock economic opportunity for excluded and underrepresented populations. The company committed $250 million over five years to advance corporate social responsibility.
