Create a react fronted application for Agentic AI system which returns a document(markdown,pdf,docs)


The application should include a text input box and a arrow button to start 

The inputed value should be sent to the localhost:8000/generate-content endpoint that's where the backend is running.
When the server returns the document the download button should be enabled and when I click the download I should be able to download the file
use the Server.py file in the backend for more context.
